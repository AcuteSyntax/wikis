Named `VDB.XML` in Burnout 3 and Legends and renamed to `VDB.BIN` starting with Burnout Revenge's demo; the **Value Database** is a hash map used exclusively by the Takedown Era of games. The VDB contains configuration data for various aspects of the game, including:
  * Per-car AI/sound/camera settings
  * Per-car boost gain/loss rates 
  * Various per-car performance and physics statistics (i.e top speeds, which are stored in the file as floating-point numbers)
  * Miscellaneous camera configuration data
  * Sound configuration
