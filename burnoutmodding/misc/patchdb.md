### **How to Download**

You can pick which cheats you want to use, or download and save the entire collection. To do the latter, follow the steps below. 

**For PS2 Burnouts:** Download the file normally, change the extension from `.TXT` to `.PNACH`, and rename the file to the CRC of the game it's meant to be used with. Your game's CRC can be found by booting the game, then opening PCSX2's console log (`Misc > Show Console`); an 8-digit ID can be seen next to the game's title, this is its CRC. 

**For PSP Burnouts:** The process is largely the same, except that the extension should be changed to `.INI` instead of `.PNACH`, and the file should be renamed to the game's Disc ID; this ID can be found in the window text of PPSSPP while running a game, next to the game's title.

After renaming the collections, drop them into your cheat file folder (`/path/to/your/PCSX2/cheats` for PCSX2, and `/path/to/your/PPSSPP/memstick/PSP/cheats` for PPSSPP).
