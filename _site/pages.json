The build’s restoration to a bootable state took nine months in total and was completed circa late 2019; this was done by using files from the November build and remnants of an unrecovered build dated January 24th, 2007, as well as recreating missing files from scratch where necessary.</p>\n\n<p>It was <a href=\"https://www.obscuregamers.com/threads/burnout-5-feb-22-2007.1416/\">publically released</a> on December 2nd of that same year.</p>\n\n<p>Other miscellaneous builds exist from around the date when the game was finalized; some of them are debug enabled.

To do the latter, follow the steps below. \n\n**For PS2 Burnouts:** Download the file normally, change the extension from `.TXT` to `.PNACH`, and rename the file to the CRC of the game it's meant to be used with. Your game's CRC can be found by booting the game, then opening PCSX2's console log (`Misc > Show Console`); an 8-digit ID can be seen next to the game's title, this is its CRC. \n\n**For PSP Burnouts:** The process is largely the same, except that the extension should be changed to `.INI` instead of `.PNACH`, and the file should be renamed to the game's Disc ID; this ID can be found in the window text of PPSSPP while running a game, next to the game's title.\n\nAfter renaming the collections, drop them into your cheat file folder (`/path/to/your/PCSX2/cheats` for PCSX2, and `/path/to/your/PPSSPP/memstick/PSP/cheats` for PPSSPP).","dir":"/burnoutmodding/misc/","name":"patchdb.md","path":"burnoutmodding/misc/patchdb.md","url":"/burnoutmodding/misc/patchdb.html"},{"layout":"default","title":null,"content":"<p>As of now this page is essentially just a compilation of research, for the sake of having it all in one place - proper organization and articles for all of this data coming soon(TM)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/118-0wUv-hTdrsVT_X9oU4lZ27lRlARHo?usp=sharing\">File format specifications</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JoondwjWoWe8nt4j9dLmiUsqj-YbBiNs\">GDrive research folder</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=4638#p26791\">Documentation for all sound formats</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W9srVbThIYwdnUwpxnRNpHNS1qE_u2og6srXDQvSIuY/edit?usp=sharing\">Savegame Spec</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nJe6t1QYTd-vNd-BTWy9hl6_yQCbL3_yNvCmV1KDY5M/edit?usp=sharing\">Paradise Remastered Vertex Format</a></p>\n","dir":"/burnoutmodding/paradise/","name":"formats.md","path":"burnoutmodding/paradise/formats.md","url":"/burnoutmodding/paradise/formats.html"},{"File Formats":"Takedown-Era","layout":"default","title":null,"content":"<p>File format documentation for the Takedown Era of games.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://acutesyntax.github.io/wikis/burnoutmodding/takedown-era/formats/bgd.html\">BGD (Burnout Game Data)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://acutesyntax.github.io/wikis/burnoutmodding/takedown-era/formats/bgvspecsv1.html\">BGV/BTV (Burnout Game Vehicle/Traffic Vehicle)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://acutesyntax.github.io/wikis/burnoutmodding/takedown-era/formats/hwd+lwd.html\">HWD and LWD</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://acutesyntax.github.io/wikis/burnoutmodding/takedown-era/formats/rwstream.html\">RWS (RenderWare Stream)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://acutesyntax.github.io/wikis/burnoutmodding/takedown-era/formats/stringarray.html\">String Array</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://acutesyntax.github.io/wikis/burnoutmodding/takedown-era/formats/texdic.html\">TXD (Texture Dictionary)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://acutesyntax.github.io/wikis/burnoutmodding/takedown-era/formats/wavedic.html\">AWD (Wave Dictionary)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://acutesyntax.github.io/wikis/burnoutmodding/takedown-era/formats/valuedb.html\">VDB.XML/VDB.BIN (Value Database)</a></p>\n","dir":"/burnoutmodding/takedown-era/","name":"formats.md","path":"burnoutmodding/takedown-era/formats.md","url":"/burnoutmodding/takedown-era/formats.html"},{"title":"BGD (Burnout Game Data)","layout":"default","content":"<p>The <strong>Burnout Game Data</strong> (.BGD) filetype contains configuration data and settings for each track, like the traffic density levels, whether or not the track is forward or reverse, the spawn coordinates of player and traffic cars, the start/end location of a lap, signature takedown data, and much more.</p>\n\n<p>Burnout 2 uses BGD to store its track data as well (albeit a much older version of the format).
