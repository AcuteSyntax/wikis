This page is intended to provide some context to Burnout's various prerelease or otherwise non-retail builds, as well the terms surrounding them. Download links for most of the builds can also be found here.</p> <h3 id="burnout-1-and-2"><strong>Burnout 1 and 2</strong></h3> <p>A few demos and prerelease builds of the first 2 PS2 Burnout games exist, though for the most part they are identical to their retail versions.</p> <p>Burnout 1 has two demos; the first was compiled <em>one day</em> before the final retail build, so while it still counts as a prerelease, it is virtually identical to the final game. The other, known as the "Trade Demo", was actually compiled three days <em>after</em> the final retail build. Strangely, unlocking the menus of the latter reveals the version code of the build: "Beta v0.88", which is odd considering this is a post-release build.</p> <p><a href="https://mega.nz/file/v3RiRLJb#NXhvRC5uyIiTbdhtNFbnFrBg2ABRCXJ2LndVv69JIW8">Download Trade Demo w/ Unlocked Menus</a></p> <p>Burnout 2 has a single full prerelease build, dated August 31st, 2002, about a week before the final build's date of September 5th, 2002. As with B1's demos, and as expected from a build this late in development, it possesses virtually <strong>no</strong> differences to the final version, save for the main executable being a different size.</p> <p>The sole exception to the recurring rule is Burnout 2's prerelease demo, compiled on August 6th, 2002, almost a month before the final build. Like B1's demos, it has also had its main menus unlocked to reveal minor, mostly cosmetic differences.</p> <p><a href="https://mega.nz/file/v3RiRLJb#NXhvRC5uyIiTbdhtNFbnFrBg2ABRCXJ2LndVv69JIW8">Download Demo w/ Unlocked Menus</a></p> <p><a href="https://archive.org/download/Burnout2PointofImpact20020831/Burnout_2-Point_of_Impact-2002-08-31.7z">Download August 31 Build</a></p> <h3 id="takedown"><strong>Takedown</strong></h3> <p>Two publically available builds of Burnout 3: Takedown's PS2 version exist. They are the <strong>"Review Build"</strong>, built July 20th, 2004, and the <strong>Promo Demo</strong>, built April 28th, 2004. Recently, the latter was patched to sport functioning menus, revealing otherwise hidden content, so it's being counted as a build as well, similar to the Legends prerelease demo.</p> <p><a href="https://www.obscuregamers.com/threads/burnout-3-takedown-review-build-july-20th-2004.2670/">The Review build was publically released on August 15th, 2020</a> and can be downloaded <a href="https://mega.nz/file/U80i2IwQ#LLRQr4-_vHGA7v4KlXLDjJms53Y2BDp-0PV9SjHmqlo">here.</a></p> <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-pLKE9iFYX-zvPPl41-AbDIL5SnxzVvp/view?usp=sharing">Download Demo w/ Unlocked Menus</a></p> <h3 id="legends"><strong>Legends</strong></h3> <p>There are two publically available betas of Burnout Legends - the first is a "normal" build dated July 8th, 2005 that is commonly referred to as the "Demo Build", due to it being discovered on an Official PlayStation Magazine demo multidisc.</p> <p>The second is a debug-enabled build presumably compiled on June 6th of the same year; it's usually referred to as the "GS build" or "Game Sharing Build", due to its executable being discovered hidden in plain sight among the assets of the July 8th demo in the place of where a Game Sharing executable would normally be (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">UPLOAD.DAT</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">DATA\</code> folder).</p> <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nhn-qLcg7i9KgoDxN4qMuGiFMfYTxv-E/view?usp=sharing">Download July 8th Build</a></p> <p><a href="https://mega.nz/file/p1ZUxbxZ#HDqj0yhAZPa1SEt7464hdWS2oB4_CovyuifQWk6Oju8">Download June 6th Debug Build (thanks to JustAnyone for uploading a prebuilt!)</a></p> <h3 id="revenge"><strong>Revenge</strong></h3> <p>The <strong>Alpha 7</strong> build of Burnout Revenge's PS2 version (also known as the <strong>0714</strong> beta, which refers to its build date) was leaked circa January 2019. It has a build date of July 14th, 2005 and contains a relatively large amount of differences to the final version despite being relatively close to retail, most notably the presence of debug symbols in the build's executable. Indepth documentation of this build <a href="https://tcrf.net/Proto:Burnout_Revenge_(PlayStation_2,_Xbox)/Alpha_7_(PlayStation_2)">can be found on TCRF.</a></p> <p>Various PS2 and Xbox demo builds of Revenge also exist; the first of which (Madden NFL 06 Xbox demo) was compiled May 29th, 2005, nearly three months before the final build.</p> <p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/s3eva4r4xzndtft/Burnout_Revenge_14.07.2005.rar/file">Download Alpha 7</a></p> <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1qQCUy49KUjEZ3pnZce2m-6SlTzL1TOSN">Download Unpacked Demo Build Collection (compiled by Edness)</a></p> <h3 id="dominator"><strong>Dominator</strong></h3> <p>The <strong>Production 10</strong> build of Burnout Dominator's PS2 version was leaked in the Alpha Archive Discord server circa July 2020 and released on ObscureGamers near the end of that same month. It consists only of the game's executable, and while it is not a prerelease build (compiled a week after retail), it is fully debug-enabled in the same vein as Burnout Legends' June 6th build. Also, akin to the Alpha 7 build of Burnout Revenge, it has full debug symbols.</p> <p><a href="https://mega.nz/file/vD4FhKwD#8gA4_QFZA6WngcM7Maev5eWRcp8TOooKEbP7gBaIUD0">Download</a></p> <h3 id="paradise"><strong>Paradise</strong></h3> <p>Two very early development builds of Burnout Paradise (then known as <strong>Burnout 5</strong>) were released in 2019.</p> <p>The first of them is dated November 13th, 2006 and is mainly known as the <strong>Franchise Build</strong> or just the <strong>2006 build.</strong> It's quite complete despite being quite an early (and buggy) build; all of its files were recovered and thus is fully functional. This build was leaked on February 16th, 2019, and hastily released by burninrubber0 soon after.</p> <p>The second is dated February 22nd, 2007. It was in a significantly more damaged (and initially unbootable) state than the November build, due to the Xbox 360 devkit it was discovered on having been used multiple times over. The build's restoration to a bootable state took nine months in total and was completed circa late 2019; this was done by using files from the November build and remnants of an unrecovered build dated January 24th, 2007, as well as recreating missing files from scratch where necessary.</p> <p>It was <a href="https://www.obscuregamers.com/threads/burnout-5-feb-22-2007.1416/">publically released</a> on December 2nd of that same year.</p> <p>Other miscellaneous builds exist from around the date when the game was finalized; some of them are debug enabled. Download links for them, as well as links for the Nov. 13/Feb. 22 builds, can be found in the list below.</p> <p><a href="https://www.obscuregamers.com/threads/burnout-5-paradise-builds.2907/">Full list of all known Burnout 5/Paradise builds</a></p> </div> </div> <div class="navigation-bottom d-flex flex-justify-between py-3" role="navigation" aria-label="footer navigation"> <div class="prev"></div> <div class="next"><a href="/wikis/burnoutmodding/misc/patchdb.html" class="btn" title="Patches/Cheats Database" accesskey="n" rel="next"> Next <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> </a></div> </div><hr> <div class="copyright text-center text-gray" role="contentinfo"> <i class="fa fa-copyright"></i> <span class="time">2020,</span> <a class="text-gray" href="https://github.com/acutesyntax" target="_blank">acutesyntax</a> Revision <a class="text-gray" href="https://github.com/acutesyntax/wikis/commit/cb52e540cad603925e51f88782a750ddb5fa4732" title="cb52e540cad603925e51f88782a750ddb5fa4732" target="_blank">cb52e54</a> </div> </div> </div> <div class="addons-wrap d-flex flex-column overflow-y-auto"> <div class="status d-flex flex-justify-between p-2"> <div class="title p-1"> <i class="fa fa-book"></i> Acute's Wikis </div> <div class="branch p-1"> <span class="name"> gh-pages </span> <i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i> </div> </div> <div class="addons d-flex flex-column height-full p-2 d-none"><dl> <dt>GitHub</dt> <dd> <a href="https://github.com/acutesyntax/wikis" title="Stars: "> <i class="fa fa-github"></i> Homepage </a> </dd> <dd> <a href="https://github.com/acutesyntax/wikis/issues" title="Open issues: "> <i class="fa fa-question-circle-o"></i> Issues </a> </dd> <dd> <a href="https://github.com/acutesyntax/wikis/zipball/gh-pages" title="Size: Kb"> <i class="fa fa-download"></i> Download </a> </dd> </dl> <dl> <dt>Statistics</dt> <dd> <a href="https://github.com/rundocs/analytics" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"> Total visits: <span id="counter"> <span class="AnimatedEllipsis"></span> </span> </a> </dd> </dl> <hr> <div class="generator f6 pb-2"> Built with <a href="https://github.com/rundocs/jekyll-rtd-theme" target="_blank" title=" theme v2.0.8">jekyll-rtd-theme</a> provided by <a href="https://rundocs.io" target="_blank">RunDocs</a> </div> </div> </div> <script> window.ui = { collect: new URL("https://rundocs-analytics.glitch.me/collect?v=2.0.8&lang=en"), title: "Acute's Wikis", baseurl: "/wikis", i18n: { search_results: "Search Results", search_results_found: "Search finished, found # page(s) matching the search query.", search_results_not_found: "Your search did not match any documents, please make sure that all characters are spelled correctly!" } }; </script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rundocs/jekyll-rtd-theme@2.0.8/assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rundocs/jekyll-rtd-theme@2.0.8/assets/js/theme.min.js"></script> </body> </html>
